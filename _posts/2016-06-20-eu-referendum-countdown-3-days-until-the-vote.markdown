With the European referendum just [3 days away](https://www.eureferendum.gov.uk/) at the time of writing this, both sides of the argument have been heating up immensely in a last ditch effort to swing voters in a certain direction. Campaigning was suspended for 5 days following the murder of MP Jo Cox, the point in which the vote took an unexpectedly distressing turn. To say that passions are high would be an understatement at this point, yet the argument rages on around Britain’s uncertain future with or without the EU.

Much has changed in the past six months in the build up to the vote too. Immigration in particular has become a more prominent issue, with a rising number of refugees fleeing the Middle East and resettling in Europe. Previous pledges by the prime minister to cap immigration numbers are being touted as unfeasible, yet the leave camp seems unable to show how immigration could be better curbed outside of the European Union. Many in the leave camp, in particular Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and, of course, Nigel Farage, have been accused of leveraging these fears on immigration to push their agenda.

Meanwhile, the remain camp repeatedly puts forward the expert opinion of business leaders, economic and law professionals as one of its main arguments to remain. This highlights a key difference between how each side is approaching the argument, one is more logical at this point, whilst the other becomes increasingly ideological; both are effective at capturing people’s attention, this much is clear.

Beyond the economic and ideological problems presented by Brexit, the legal fallout is also of heightened concern to lawmakers across the country. A collective of [lawyers in Surrey](http://www.healdnickinson.co.uk/), London, and Kent have pointed out the impending boom in complicated legal work as a result of carefully unpicking and altering UK laws which have become deeply entangled with EU laws at this point. However, they go on to say that every boom is usually followed by a bust, and it is unclear exactly how long these difficult times could last.

With just 3 days to go, there still seems to be too much uncertainty surrounding the leave campaign. Michael Gove on Question Time said that there will be bumps in the road if we decide to leave the EU, yet he refused to identify any of them, showing a typical disregard for any kind of fair political process. If Gove has any confidence in the better sense of his fellow countrymen, wouldn’t he surely have no problem relaying the potential risks of a Brexit to us?

This shows how the tone of the debate has changed significantly over the course of the month. George Osborne was also guilty of this, as he pre-announced potential cuts and higher-taxes that could be implemented as a result of a Brexit. Rightly so, many have called Osborne out for playing on people’s fears around the economy. David Cameron expanded by saying that either tax hikes or spending cuts would need to be implemented in some form, but these may not take the form of Osborne's proposed measures. Even 3 days out, leaders of the Remain campaign are also unable to come to a consensus.

One of the other big questions that has arisen from the referendum is what happens to the Prime Minister David Cameron if we choose to leave. Cameron finally had a chance to respond on Question Time last weekend, where he reminded the audience that it was just under a year ago that the Conservatives were voted into government, and that the EU referendum was arguably unrelated to his status as Prime Minister.

The distortion on both sides makes it more difficult to come to a reasonable conclusion, yet I implore everyone eligible to make their vote count on June 23rd. If you still cannot make a decision, there is nothing wrong with following your gut, because in these uncertain times we will all just be making educated guesses.
