Apple, much like many others of its ilk, frequently capitalises on its successes in the technology sector to drive innovations in various other industries. Most of these are either spin-offs of its existing areas of business, or companies which the tech giant has purchased to gain a better foothold in emerging markets. As of May 2014, Apple had completed 27 acquisitions.

Either way, Apple is always keen to acquire new companies that can bolster its ongoing product line. Apple’s business model of floating mid cycle upgrades constantly requires new technologies to help sell newer models of phones and tablets; without these features, it would be considerably more difficult for Apple to convince consumers to splash out on its upgraded products.

So what Apple subsidiaries are crucial to the corporations’ continued success and profitability?

**Beats Electronics**

Apple’s acquisition of [Beats Electronics](http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/9/5699032/beats-by-dre-visual-history) was the largest in its history, valued at $3 billion. The company, famously started by Dr. Dre, (who now serves as a consultant at Apple) produces high-end headphones and speakers, but also has a recognisable brand that has become associated with modern music culture.

Apple certainly saw the value in the brand, as they used it to launch their flagship online radio show as part of Apple Music, their brand new streaming service. Apple hardware now also comes with built in beatsaudio technology, which according to the manufacturer provides better sound quality for music playback.

**Emagic**

Although the name may not sound familiar, Emagic produced a music sequencer named Logic, which would go on to become [Logic Pro](http://www.apple.com/uk/logic-pro/). Logic Pro is now one of the most widely used music production software solutions, along with Ableton Live. Apple would also use patents developed and owned by Emagic to create GarageBand, its more accessible music software that has been part of the iLife Suite bundle for decades.

Logic has been a big success for Apple, surviving in a competitive market for over a decade and a half, spending the majority of that time as an industry frontrunner. In turn, Apple has been able to develop a range of apps for its mobile products based on Logic, meaning this success is able to transfer to an (at the time) emerging market.

**FileMaker**

Apple itself revolutionised the use of apps in consumer electronics, so it should come as no surprise that [FileMaker](https://www.isos.com/services/databases), then known as Claris, played a big part in shaping this outlook for Apple’s future. The product was once part of Microsoft’s portfolio, but after a decision to self-publish version 4 of the software, FileMaker became independent again before settling back down at Apple.

The software itself is now part of Apple’s continued efforts to further reinforce itself in the market for business technologies, a place which Microsoft and IBM have long had a stronghold. We can expect to see much more FileMaker as Apple pushes into the B2B market.

**FoundationDB**

[FoundationDB](http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/24/apple-acquires-durable-database-company-foundationdb/) is a recent but potentially crucial acquisition by Apple. The start-up, which specialises in hyper-speed NoSQL databases, was acquired in March last year, before being shut down and assimilated into Apple’s products and services. In particular, FoundationDB’s work could be applied to Apple’s many applications which require fast access to data, including music and video.

One area of Apple’s operations which could benefit from this purchase is its cloud computing infrastructure. Faster data capabilities means consumers get a better service, and a broader range of cloud services offered means faster requisition across many of its products.
