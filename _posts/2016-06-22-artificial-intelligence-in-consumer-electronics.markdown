Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a hot topic of debate in the tech world. We are slowly arriving at the theoretical point in which advanced AI could be implemented in many of our consumer electronics, and many of the world’s largest and most profitable tech companies are catching on. This isn’t to say that AI doesn’t exist in many aspects of our technology already, because we’ve already got applications like Siri for Apple or Cortana for Microsoft, both of which were invested in heavily by their respective parent companies.

And yet, investment in advanced AI technologies is ramping up considerably. Most recently, Twitter purchased AI startup Magic Pony, which uses computational prowess and intelligence to provide visual processing, much in the same way Google’s artificial neural network is able to conjure images based on shapes it interprets from other images. In consumer terms, this technology could be applied to the growing number of visual marketing tools that have proven to be popular for audience engagement. Video now accounts of a larger than ever slice of this pie, and tech firms do not want their content to be limited.

The multitude of debate surrounding AI in the tech community centres around the potential damage it could cause to us as a species. This has long been speculated upon in many science fiction films, most notably The Matrix and Terminator. In these films, rogue AI’s take control to either enslave or terminate the human race. This may sound fantastical, but many prominent figures in the world of science such as [Elon Musk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat) and [Stephen Hawking](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30290540) have warned that developing AI’s further will endanger the human race.

Google itself has also been ramping up its development of robotic and AI technologies considerably. The various acquisitions by its holding company Alphabet, itself a creation for the diversification of its business ventures, suggest a deeper affinity between Google’s multiple acquisitions and its AI aspirations. Boston Dynamics, a robotics company famous for its resilient and all terrain robots, was famously purchased by Google around 5 years ago for unknown reasons. At the same time, the company also invested in an artificial navigational system, and it was soon realised the two would be used in tandem to map new areas for its street view service. This shows how AI can be used in tandem to expand and improve existing technologies.

AI therefore has a place in many modern consumer technologies; we’ve seen a variety of practical applications in areas including [corporate performance management software](http://www.prevero.com/en/solutions/performance-management.html), wearable tech, and social media marketing to name a few. However, we must also ask ourselves whether this is a sign of impending AI dominance, or simply tech firms testing the waters? We’ve seen on multiple occasions that AI isn’t quite up to the standard of those science fictions films. One such notable case is Microsoft’s Twitter AI Tay, which upon being unleashed on the world starting repeating racist diatribe that users had sent its way. Ultimately, the [AI was taken offline](http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/03/25/learning-tays-introduction/#sm.0001j5w22sd6tddqqwj28flw4aiqm) for ‘adjustments’.

This highlights the uncertainties that the world of artificial intelligence presents. Tay ended up being a huge embarrassment for Microsoft, mainly because its learning capabilities were completely influenced by the public. There is clearly still much development to be committed to these technologies; maybe Google should keep their intelligent robot dogs out of human contact, for both their sake and ours!
