You remember when your mum kept nagging you to get straight into work after school, college or university. “You’ll regret it when September comes around and everyone is starting a new chapter”. All you wanted to do was spend your time enjoying the summer sun (or lack thereof for UK residents), make new friends and create those memories that will last forever. But what if I told you, you can do exactly that in another, far sunnier country and make an incredible lasting difference to members of the local community by volunteering?

Volunteering isn’t necessarily picking litter from local parks or directing rush hour traffic in a high visibility vest. I’m not degrading either role, but at the end of the day – people will still litter, and as sure as the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening, people will drive angrily to work during rush hour. Look further afield than your home town. Look even further than England – even Europe. 

There are an incredible number and calibre of volunteering opportunities, from sports coaching in South Africa to construction work in Nepal. To reuse my least favourite cliché – there really is something for everyone. Be sure that a [student volunteer abroad](http://www.bunac.org/uk/volunteer-abroad) programme has a far more meaningful effect on the community and lives of those they volunteer for.

Of course the role of volunteering differs enormously. Sometimes you’ll be providing essential basic facilities and infrastructure to towns and villages still recovering from famine, poverty or natural disaster. You may find yourself planting seeds and repairing protected nature reserves. Other hours may be spent teaching children languages or sports.

Whilst I am very much of the opinion that not every action deserves a reward – there’s no reason why you can’t spare a thought for priority number 1 (that’s you) when you make the decision to volunteer. After all, we’re living in an economic market completely sided against graduates and school leavers – in fact, [58.8% of university graduates in the UK are in non-graduate work roles](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/19/uk-failed-create-enough-high-skilled-jobs-graduates-student-debt-report), complimented by [unemployment at its lowest rate in the UK since 2005](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36536432). This is an incredibly saturated and competitive job market. Meaning that as a potential applicant, it is of paramount importance that you stand out from the crowd.

Staffing Director of DaVita, a Fortune 500 Company specialising in kidney dialysis, Tony Blake believes that adding any volunteering experience you might have to your CV “adds depth”, “experience” and “it gets noticed”. Adding volunteering experience to your CV is particularly potent when it is in some way relevant or applicable to your interview role. 

A staggering 100% of recent BUNAC volunteers in the US felt they could apply the experience gained to their career. The Corporation for National and Community Service (US) recently found that those who had taken upon volunteer positions have a 27% higher chance of finding work, after being out of work. Even more impressive, comes the revelation that volunteers in rural areas of the US have a 55% better chance of getting a job compared to those without volunteering experience.

*“The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others” – Ghandi*

Facts and figures out of the way. Expect to fully immerse yourself in the culture, climate and company of incredible countries and even more incredible people. Surely the prospect of a profound community project against the picturesque backdrop of the Himalayas is far more enticing than spending hours a day on Facebook and Instagram, watching other people enjoy their summers abroad.

The son of a close friend attended a summer camp in the US after leaving college. He left, a naïve college graduate, with little or no idea of what he wanted to do with his life. During his time at summer camp, he served as mentor and councillor to a number of children from incredibly poor areas of the southern states. Previously, he served on rugby and football teams – he stands at six foot three, and was completely moved to tears by the experiences of the children he met. I can’t describe how much of an impact his volunteering experience had on his outlook on life. He always was more gentle giant than he let on. But never had we heard him speak so highly and respectfully of those less fortunate than he. 

He is still good friends and communicates regularly with the other camp councillors he met during his time and even volunteers locally, teaching cricket to behaviourally challenged school children. His English friends still travel abroad with one another to Ibiza, Zante, Marbella and Kavos and get up to all sorts of mischief. But he feels a greater inclination to avoid the ‘lad holidays’ and focus on his career goals.

His volunteering experience gave him the much needed break from formal education and time to think about what he really wanted to achieve. It’s worth bearing in mind, that he didn’t particularly enjoy school. He hasn’t attended university, he has no degree and whilst he has A levels – they cater to radically different industries than the one he now works in. It may only be an entry level media position, but he got the job ahead of eight other university graduates. His new employers can’t speak highly enough of his professionalism, manner and drive to work. 

With a first-hand experience of the profound benefits of volunteering, I can’t recommend the opportunity highly enough. If you’re out of work, out of school, out of luck. Look no further. Volunteering might be the break in fortune you need.
